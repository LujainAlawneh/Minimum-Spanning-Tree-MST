**Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**

This project solves the Minimum Spanning Tree problem using graphs in C.
It was done for the course COMP2421 (Data Structures).

In this project, a weighted graph is created and an algorithm is used to find the Minimum Spanning Tree,
which connects all vertices with the minimum possible total edge weight and without forming cycles.

The program reads the graph data, processes the edges, and selects the edges that belong to the MST
based on their weights.

The project focuses on:
- Representing a graph in C
- Working with weighted edges
- Applying the Minimum Spanning Tree concept
- Understanding how graph algorithms work
